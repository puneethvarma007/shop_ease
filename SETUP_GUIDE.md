# ShopEase Setup Guide

## 🎉 Your Database Schema is Perfect!

I can see you have an excellent, comprehensive database schema already set up. The backend has been updated to work seamlessly with your schema structure.

## 🚀 Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Add Sample Data (Recommended)

To get started quickly with demo data, run this in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire content from backend/SAMPLE_DATA.sql
-- This will create a demo store with offers, sections, and sample analytics data
```

This will create:
- ✅ Demo store: "Elegant Boutique"
- ✅ Store sections: Jewelry, Fashion, Kids, Electronics
- ✅ Sample offers across all categories
- ✅ Feedback questions
- ✅ Sample QR scan data for analytics
- ✅ Sample sales data

### 2. Environment Variables

**Backend** (`backend/.env`):
```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
```

**Frontend** (`frontend/.env.local`):
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### 3. Start the Applications

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 4. Test the Demo

1. **Visit**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Try Demo Store**: http://localhost:3000/demo-store?storeId=YOUR_STORE_UUID
3. **Manager Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000/dashboard

## 🔧 Backend Updates Made

I've updated the backend to work perfectly with your schema:

### ✅ Auth Routes (`auth.routes.js`)
- Fixed to use `is_verified` field (matches your schema)
- Better error handling for RLS issues
- Proper field mapping

### ✅ Feedback Routes (`feedback.routes.js`)
- Updated to use `store_id` instead of `store_slug`
- Fixed field names: `response_text` instead of `text_answer`
- Backward compatibility for demo purposes

### ✅ Analytics Routes (`analytics.routes.js`)
- Added `scan_type` field support
- Updated to use `scanned_at` timestamp
- Enhanced with IP and User-Agent tracking

## 🎯 Key Features Working

## 🧪 Testing the Application

### 1. Demo Store Access
```
URL: http://localhost:3000/demo-store
Query: ?storeId=YOUR_DEMO_STORE_UUID
```

### 2. Section-Specific QR
```
URL: http://localhost:3000/demo-store/offers
Query: ?storeId=YOUR_STORE_UUID&sectionId=YOUR_SECTION_UUID
```

### 3. Registration Flow
- Use any name, email, phone
- OTP for demo: **123456**

### 4. Manager Dashboard
```
URL: http://localhost:3000/dashboard
Enter your store UUID in the dashboard
```

## 🔍 Getting Store/Section UUIDs

Run this in Supabase to get your UUIDs:

```sql
-- Get store UUID
SELECT id, name, email FROM public.stores;

-- Get section UUIDs
SELECT s.id, s.name, st.name as store_name 
FROM public.store_sections s 
JOIN public.stores st ON s.store_id = st.id;
```

## 🎨 Beautiful UI Features

Your ShopEase application includes:

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Registration Fails:
1. Check that you're using the **SERVICE_ROLE_KEY** in backend
2. Verify your Supabase project URL is correct
3. Ensure RLS policies are working (they should be with your schema)

### If Offers Don't Load:
1. Run the sample data script to populate offers
2. Check that your store UUID is correct
3. Verify the backend is running on port 5000

### If QR Codes Don't Work:
1. Make sure you have store and section UUIDs
2. Test the URLs manually first
3. Check that the frontend can reach the backend
